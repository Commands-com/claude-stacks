   ```

## Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Run in development mode with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run test` - Run complete test suite with coverage
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode during development
- `npm run test:unit` - Run only unit tests
- `npm run test:integration` - Run only integration tests
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run end-to-end tests
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` - Fix auto-fixable linting issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check code formatting
- `npm run typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking
- `npm run quality` - Run all quality checks (lint + format + typecheck)
- `npm run quality:fix` - Fix all auto-fixable quality issues

### Code Quality Standards

This project maintains high code quality standards:

- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 95%+ test coverage
- **Linting**: All code must pass ESLint checks
- **Formatting**: Code must be formatted with Prettier
- **Type Safety**: All TypeScript code must pass type checking
- **Git Hooks**: Pre-commit hooks ensure quality standards

### Testing Guidelines

#### Test Structure

The project uses Jest with comprehensive test coverage organized as:

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Unit tests for individual functions/classes
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Integration tests for service interactions
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/           # End-to-end tests for full workflows
â””â”€â”€ performance/   # Performance and load tests
```

#### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions in isolation with mocks
- **Integration tests**: Test service interactions with real dependencies
- **E2E tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Mock isolation**: Always reset mocks in `beforeEach()` to prevent test interference

#### Test Patterns

```typescript
// Good: Proper mock setup and isolation
beforeEach(() => {
  jest.clearAllMocks();

  // Reset module-level mocks explicitly
  const { colors } = require('../../../src/utils/colors.ts');
  colors.info = jest.fn().mockImplementation((text: string) => text);

  const pathConstants = require('../../../src/constants/paths.ts');
  pathConstants.getLocalClaudeDir = jest.fn(() => '/test/project/.claude');
});

// Good: Test exact console output expectations
expect(mockConsoleLog).toHaveBeenCalledWith(
  'ðŸ“¥ Fetching stack test-org/test-stack from Commands.com...'
);
```

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test files
npm test -- tests/unit/actions/install.test.ts

# Run tests with specific name pattern
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should install a stack"

# Debug test failures
npm run test:debug
```

## Code Style and Architecture

### File Organization

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ actions/        # CLI command implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers/    # High-level business logic controllers
â”œâ”€â”€ services/       # Core business services
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Utility functions and helpers
â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # TypeScript type definitions
â”œâ”€â”€ constants/      # Application constants
â””â”€â”€ ui/            # User interface utilities
```

### Coding Conventions

- **TypeScript**: Use strict TypeScript with proper typing
- **Error Handling**: Use custom error types from `src/types/errors.ts`
- **Logging**: Use the color utility functions from `src/utils/colors.ts`
- **Services**: Follow dependency injection patterns
- **Actions**: Extend `BaseAction` for CLI commands
- **Testing**: Mock external dependencies, test error scenarios

### Architecture Patterns

- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated into focused services
- **Controller Pattern**: High-level orchestration in controllers
- **Command Pattern**: CLI commands as action classes
- **Dependency Injection**: Services injected via constructors
- **Error Boundaries**: Proper error handling and user feedback

## Development Tips

### Debugging

- Use `npm run test:debug` to debug failing tests
- Check `lint_failures.log` for detailed linting issues
- Use the development scripts for faster iteration

### Understanding the Codebase

1. Start with `src/cli.ts` to understand the CLI structure
2. Look at `src/actions/` for command implementations
3. Review `src/services/` for core business logic
4. Check `tests/` for usage examples and edge cases

### Working with the API

- API integration is in `src/services/ApiService.ts`
- Authentication logic is in `src/utils/auth.ts`
- Test API interactions with mocked responses

## Getting Help

- **Documentation**: Check the README and inline code comments
- **Issues**: Browse existing GitHub issues for similar problems
- **Discussions**: Start a GitHub discussion for questions
- **Tests**: Look at test files for usage examples
